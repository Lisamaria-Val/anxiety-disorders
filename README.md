# Anxiety Disorders Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that visualizes functional MRI data for anxiety disorders. However, this code can be used for the visualization of any Neurosynth psychological concept since the file selection and figure titles are dependent on user input.

# Figures
The two figures included in the notebook show 1) regions with strong associations when functional data is laid on top of the anatomical scan and 2) a histogram of positive functional data values.
